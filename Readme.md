# Track eval and PV of 1. g4 on chessdb.cn

Track the evaluation and PV of 1. g4, as well as the other four non-zero
opening moves for white, on [chessdb.cn](https://chessdb.cn/queryc_en/).

The raw polling data is obtained with the help of the script
`cdbpvpoll.py` from [cdblib](https://github.com/robertnurnberg/cdblib).
Note that the displayed evaluations in each case are for the position _after_ the first 
move by white was made, so (a) they are positive and (b) they will 
in general differ slightly from the evaluation shown for the move in the start
position at [chessdb.cn](https://chessdb.cn/queryc_en/).
